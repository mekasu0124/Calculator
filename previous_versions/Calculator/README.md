### Welcome

Welcome to Calculator Version 0.1.0!

This calculator is a console-based calculator. What does that mean? That means there are no fancy buttons and a pretty screen with nice colors. It's black and white baby with a hint of some other colors here and there üòé. This calculator was inspired by my dear friend <a href="https://github.com/ccSolly">solly</a> of whom is a new Python programmer. I decided to build alongside him while he builds his calcalutor as apart of him seeing how different coders program, how they write their code, and what the definition of a <i><u>programmers signature</u></i> may look like. So without further or due, please welcome Calculator Version 0.1.0!üëèüéâ
